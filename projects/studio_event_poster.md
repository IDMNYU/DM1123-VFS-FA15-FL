## Studio Exercise: Hierarchy Studies

In this exercise, you will create a series of composition studies that will act as mini-posters for an event of your choosing.

* **Choose an event that will be the subject of your posters**
    * The event can be a museum exhibition, a gallery opening, a concert, a film series, etc, as long as it has the following:
        * Title
        * Date(s)
        * Short description (roughly 20-40 words)
        * The name of the institution sponsoring or housing the event
        * 2–4 different artists, acts, films, or relevant items that are a part of the event
    * You can use an upcoming event at an actual institution (like MoMA or BAM), or it can be fictional


* **Using the printed template provided, sketch 10 concepts for each word (total of 30 sketches)**
  * Experiments with the various composition concepts mentioned in class and in the readings
  * Compositions should express the meaning of the word
  * Use only one word per comp
  * Use only one color, the black / gray of your pen or pencil (no colored pencils or markers)


* **Take the 3 strongest sketches for each word, and develop them as compositions in Illustrator (total of 9 comps)**
  * After translating your sketch to the computer, see if you can refine it further to make the composition more dynamic, as well as enhance its relation to the word's meaning 
  * Use Futura as the typeface (or similar geometric sans serif, if you don't have access to Futura)
  * Type color must be 100% black (no shades of gray)


* **Come to Tuesday's class with your hand sketches and printed versions of the Illustrator comps**
    * We will pin them up for presentation and critique
