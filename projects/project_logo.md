# PROJECT: PHYSICAL APPLICATION (PA)
Your final logo in color in a physical, applied state (i.e. poster, packaging, signage, apparel, business cards, stickers, etc.). Your choice for your logo’s applied state is up to you. You decide. There are literally hundreds of possible applied states. 

#### PA 1st Draft    
Post on your class website in grayscale (includes black and white)
* Select 1 applied state for your one and true final logo
* For that selected applied state only, do at least 3 different directions 
* In other words, if you are going to do a cd cover, all 3 different versions should be for a cd cover. If you are doing a business card, all 3 different versions should be for a business card. 
* One version each within letter-sized dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)
* Select only 1 applied state (yes, this is repeated.)
* The versions should NOT be for different applied states such as 1 for an album cover, tattoos, and yet another for a T-Shirt design.

#### PA 2nd Draft    
Post on your class website in color
* Choose the version selected in the previous class crit.
* Do at least 3 different variations of the selected PA. 
* Each variation in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)

#### PA Final    
Get your final physical application printed at a service bureau of your choice.
