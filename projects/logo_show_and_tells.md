#### LOGO SHOW & TELLS

* Pair up into groups of 2 (and 1 group of 3) 
* Select an established brand that has had at least 3 logo iterations (ideally more) over the years. Think outside the box. 
* Post your selection on Basecamp to the LOGO SHOW & TELLS thread as a comment. 
  * One brand per team. Teams can not do the same brand. First team who posts their choice on the class website gets the brand.
* Create a **6 minutes or less** presentation (pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.) that shows and discusses the history of the evolution of the logo. 
* You should find out the name of the logo designer (if you can), the dates that the logo was redesigned, and why it was redesigned.
* Cite your sources
* Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools)
  * Get familiar with your display preferences
* If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to **Crestron**
