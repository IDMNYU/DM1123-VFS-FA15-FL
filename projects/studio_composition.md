## Studio Exercise: Type Compositions

* **Choose 3 different words that will be the basis for typographic compositions**
    * The word's meaning should lend itself to a visual concept or physical process
    * Example words include: transition, disruption, compression, repetition, expansion, migration, elimination

* **Using the printed template provided, sketch 10 concepts for each word (total of 30 sketches)**
  * Experiments with the various composition concepts mentioned in class and in the readings
  * Compositions should express the meaning of the word
  * Use only one word per comp

* **Take the 3 strongest sketches for each word, and develop them as compositions in Illustrator (total of 9 comps)**
  * After translating your sketch to the computer, see if you can refine it further to make the composition more dynamic, as well as enhance its relation to the word's meaning 
  * Use Futura as the typeface (or similar geometric sans serif, if you don't have access to Futura)

* **Come to Tuesday's class with your hand sketches and printed versions of the Illustrator comps**
    * We will pin them up for presentation and critique
