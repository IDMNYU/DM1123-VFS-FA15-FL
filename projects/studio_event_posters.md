## Studio Exercise: Event Posters

In this exercise, you will create a series of composition studies that will act as mini-posters for an event of your choosing.

* **Choose an event that will be the subject of your posters**
    * The event can be a museum exhibition, a gallery opening, a concert, a film series, etc. 
    * Compile the following content items for it:
        * Title
        * Date(s)
        * Short description (roughly 20-40 words)
        * The name of the institution sponsoring or housing the event
        * 2–4 different artists, acts, films, or relevant items that are a part of the event
        * Images associated with the event
    * You can use an upcoming event at an actual institution (like MoMA or BAM), or it can be fictional


* **Using the printed templates, sketch 4 concepts for each of the following constraint variations (total of 16 sketches):**
  1. Spacing only&mdash;all type must be the same font and size
  2. Spacing and type weight
  3. Spacing, type weight and scale
  4. Spacing, type weight, scale, image, and rotation/axis
  
  You may only use the hierarchy techniques stated for each, and you must use all of the content items above.


* **Take the 2 strongest sketches for each variation, and develop them as compositions in Illustrator (total of 8 comps)**
  * You may choose a typeface, but use the same typeface across all the studies. The typeface should have some history to it, should have multiple weights in the family, and should be versatile enough to lend itself to multiple scales and uses (i.e. please avoid quirky display faces).
    * Suggestions include: Univers, Futura, Trade Gothic / Benton Sans, Gotham, Helvetica / Akzidenz Grotesk, Bodoni / Didot, or others mentioned in my type lecture or in the readings
  * Type color must be 100% black (no shades of gray)


* **Come to Tuesday's class with your hand sketches and printed versions of the Illustrator comps**
    * We will pin them up for presentation and critique
